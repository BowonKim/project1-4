                <h2 class="container-header">Background.</h2>
                <p>I grew up in South Korea and I came to the United States to study English and experience other
                    worlds.
                    Since
                    I
                    was young, I liked to do something with the computer so I decided to major in computer information
                    technology
                    however during the three years of college, I could not find any fields that want to study more
                    deeply
                    and
                    work
                    in the specific field. I focused on studying and getting good grades without participating in any
                    activities
                    because I didn't know what I want to do.
                    Then, while taking the graphic design and web design courses last semester, I came across web
                    development
                    for
                    the first time. While developing the website for the project, it was really interesting that I could
                    see
                    the
                    results visually right away. I thought it was a perfect field that combines design and coding that I
                    love
                    and I
                    could find what I want to do after graduation. After deciding what I want to do, I'm studying to
                    improve
                    my
                    skills these days.
